Hello,
this simple tool made by extraleet checks your replays for banned account

written in pascal/lazarus https://www.lazarus-ide.org/

you need to download the replay after each game
you need an api key from steam https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey (doesn't work with limited accounts)
you can click on the steam id and you browser goes to his steam page
steam names are currently disable because it takes a while to get all steam names

thats all 
enjoy the tool

if you have questions/bugs/any kind of support, message me https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=extraleet

regards
extraleet
